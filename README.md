BOARD INFINITY HACKATHON
DAY 1: The first day, I read the Problem Statement, and I spent my day on collecting the valuable data's regarding the project.
DAY 2: On this day I started officially working on the project and made cards, 1 Text box and 1 button. Then I implemented hooks in the function in order to switch easily within the functions.
DAY 3: As it was directed in the problem statement that We have to compare URLs, so I chose Followers, followings, public repos, public gists in order to compare them. I extracted the user input using fetch method and for that I used onChange function. I used onClick function and (.dot)oerator in order to extract the required data from the API.
